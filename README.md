# Leetcode_Challenges

## Introduction

In this repository, I document my journey of solving one LeetCode problem per week using Python. This README file provides an overview of my approach, goals, and progress.

## Goals

1. **Improving Problem-Solving Skills**: By regularly practicing on LeetCode, I aim to enhance my problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and coding proficiency in Python.
2. **Consistent Learning**: Solving one problem per week ensures consistent learning and application of data structures, algorithms, and Python programming techniques.

## Structure

The repository is organized into weekly folders, each containing the Python solution file (`solution.py`) for the respective LeetCode problem. Additionally, each folder may include a README file providing insights into my thought process, approach, and any additional notes related to the problem.

## Weekly Progress

- **Week 1**: [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
- **Week 2**: [Reverse Words in a String III](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string-iii/description/)
- **Week 3**: [ Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies](https://leetcode.com/problems/kids-with-the-greatest-number-of-candies/)

## Contributing
